# IBM-Data-Science-Capstone-SpaceX

This is the final task of the IBM Coursera Applied Data Science Capstone project to create a presentation based on the outcomes of all tasks in previous modules and labs. The presentation develops into a story of all my data science journey in this project, and it is compelling and easy to understand.
